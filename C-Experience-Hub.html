												<h3>Adaptable flooding space</h3>
											</header>
											<p>This project consists of 2 stages, first is city-scale park greenification and connectivity of 23 parks, second is an upgrade of each park in terms of rainwater collection and its reuse. The issues of this site are an absence of functional green space for people in the surrounding area and lack of an efficient rainwater collection system.</p>

												<h3>Considerations and logics of space</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The shape and size of the building goes in accordance with the surrounding context, thus blending in well and respecting the urban design codes. Both public and private zones of the project are meant to attract university staff from 4 universities and families in the 4 residential areas. The surrounding context consists of 4 universities, 4 residential areas, 3 public spaces, 1 canal, 1 pocket park, 1 gas station. </p>

											<left><h3>Public zone</h3></left>
											<p>Gradual elevation of the hub creates an opportunity to view the north campus of Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University. Traffic research consisted of car counts on the east and south side, east side concluded with higher traffic. The Odor pollution was in consideration too, therefore measures needed to be taken. The bamboo trees were planted on the east side of the site to cancel the incoming traffic noise and gas station odour. High precipitation usually floods the west side of the project. In this case, a west side intrusion was created to collect the rainwater, while also reflecting the building. The rooftop of the building collects the rainwater and uses it for the plants, bushes and trees. The zig-zag pattern creates a playful and mysterious experience along the stairs. The left and right top rails of the building allow a gentle waterfall into the second inner ground intrusion.</p>

											<left><h3>Private zone</h3></left>
											<p>Lack of adaptable exhibition space was the core of this hub. The central part of the hub could be used as a learning commons, innovative student projects, technology showcases, concerts, opera performances, cinema, presentation space and university club activities. The full glass frames are used to create a feeling of komorebi as a to show how beautiful nature is and the way light plays on trees. Both right and left extents of the hub could be used as private rooms for meetings, presentations and resting areas. The rainwater is used as grey water for the whole hub. The structure of the hub is designed to blend in with its surrounding nature, posing as an eye-friendly minimalistic structure. This hub stands as a reminder for people to be in close respectful contact with nature.</p>

												<h3>Defining elements</h3>
											</header>
											<p>The explanation of how the site works is described as in left to right order. The first diagram shows the whole hub and its elements. Second: trees, grass and bushes as rainwater catchers and komorebi creators. Third: installations and furniture such as benches, sofas, chairs, tables, exhibition walls, public space ground. Fourth: all site paths. Fifth: water and its circulation. Sixth: hub base and support structures. It is important to keep in mind that the central hub space is adaptable/dynamic to any events and is not the same/static throughout the time.</p>
